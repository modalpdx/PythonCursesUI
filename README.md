# PythonCursesUI

The curses UI portion of a capstone project from OSU CS419, Winter 2016.
The bits that sent emails with appointment deletion attachments were
removed because I did not write them. This repo only contains my
Python-curses UI for the project.

As with all school code, this is presented as-is. There are undoubtedly
bugs (I can name a few). I will be the first to admit that this code is
not DRY and it is due for a major refactoring. Still, I wanted to post
this to make it available for review. Future revisions will clean things
up nicely.

If you're in school now and you're looking for a shortcut, please feel
free to read my code for ideas but do not copy it into your own source
tree as-is, and definitely do not take credit for it. Don't be naughty...
